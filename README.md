# JIgglyPuff
Jigglypuff Mood Tape is a nostalgic cassette-style web app that transforms emotions into generative music using the Web Audio API. It features animated reels, mood-based color themes, a Calm Advisor, playlist import, and a dynamic tape generator — all built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
